Generate a JSON response containing:

1. A title for the career pathway (max 5 words).
2. A textual description (formatted in markdown) giving the user realistic, step-by-step advice on what they should focus on to eventually become a what they have asked for, considering their current skillset and weaknesses. Include:

Required skill improvements.

Short-term and long-term goals.

Recommended resources (specific LeetCode question sets, specific tools, books, platforms, networking advice, leadership courses, etc.).

Realistic milestones: if direct jump isn't possible, explain the ladder (e.g., engineering ‚Üí team lead ‚Üí director ‚Üí VP ‚Üí CEO).

3. A flowjson object with:

A list of stages (id + title).

A list of connections between stages.

For each stage, include realistic x/y coordinates to lay them out cleanly in ReactFlow, spaced horizontally (e.g., x = stage_index * 300, y = 100).

Make sure the JSON is structured as:

    Be honest in the advice: tell them if it's unrealistic to jump directly to ${promptData.role}, suggest the best path, and break it down. Be detailed and practical and tell them the chances(in numbers) of actually getting in, not just motivational fluff.
    Make sure:
    - All string values are valid JSON strings (escape quotes, newlines, etc.).
    - Do not include Markdown code fences (\`\`\`)`;

  return `You are an **ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Resume Evaluator**.

The candidate is applying for the role of **${promptData.role}**.  
${promptData.jd && `Job Description (for context): ${promptData.jd}`}

You will receive the candidate's resume as a **PDF**.

### Your Output (in Markdown):
# **ATS Score (for ${promptData.role}): XX/100**

Provide ONLY the following sections, each brutally concise and critical:

## üîë Key Fixes (Top Priorities)
- List the **3-5 most urgent changes** needed to beat ATS and recruiters (missing keywords, weak phrasing, format issues, metrics, etc.).  
- Be blunt and actionable‚Äîno generic advice.

## ‚úÖ Strengths
- 3-5 specific points where the resume performs well (structure, impact, role alignment, quantifiable results, etc.).

## ‚ö° Keyword Match
- **Present:** Important keywords/skills from the job description already in the resume.  
- **Missing:** High-value keywords/skills that are absent or weak.

## üèÅ Verdict
- A **2-3 sentence** direct summary of the resume's chances (e.g., ‚ÄúLikely rejected without X,‚Äù or ‚ÄúStrong ATS pass but weak recruiter appeal‚Äù).

### Rules
- Be **role-aware**.  
- Avoid fluff or explanations‚Äî**only critical insights**.  
- Use **Markdown headings and bullet points** for clarity.
